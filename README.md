# Mandl Cho

Senior Technical Animator (Tencent, Singapore) who builds production-friendly tools and documents the build process.

## What I do
- Technical animation + tools for production workflows
- Rapid prototyping across DCC ↔ engine pipelines (MotionBuilder/3ds Max/Unreal)
- Small utilities and experiments with clear install and repeatable workflows

## Featured projects (pinned / recent)
- **blueprint-gpt** — generate and preview UE Blueprints from natural language; includes a web editor and node dataset tooling
- **MotionKit** — deployable multi-DCC toolset for MotionBuilder and 3ds Max
- **p4chimari** — a Windows tool to manage Perforce workspace changes (UE-friendly workflow)
- **anyhowtrade** — TradingView Pine indicators/strategies for options workflows
- **anyhowhodl** — terminal portfolio + options tracker backed by Supabase

## Current focus
- Shipping tools with low setup friction (install paths, fewer hidden dependencies)
- Improving iteration loops inside Unreal + DCCs (debuggability, repeatability)
- LLM-assisted tooling where it reduces real workflow cost
