## Selected work

### SpendWhat? (in progress)
Telegram-first expense capture + web one-pager insights.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/SpendWhat
- Focus: minimal setup, minimal dependencies, privacy-respecting by default.
- Core loop: capture (Telegram) → normalize (rules) → review (needs_review) → insight (MTD, category/merchant).

### MotionKit
Deployable multi-DCC pipeline toolset for MotionBuilder and 3ds Max.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/MotionKit
- Focus: repeatable installs, discoverability via menus, team-friendly distribution.

### p4chimari
A Windows tool to manage Perforce workspace changes with an Unreal Engine-style workflow.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/p4chimari
- Focus: safer reconcile/revert workflows, reduced changelist noise, fast cleanup.

## How I work
- Start with the input loop: capture frictionlessly, then make output worth it.
- Prototype early, measure quickly, cut scope aggressively.
- Prefer simple, auditable rules before adding “AI”.
- Design for ops: defaults, safety rails, and failure modes.
