# Mandl Cho

I build products that solve real problems. For 8+ years I've shipped animation systems enjoyed by millions of players.

## How I work

Watch what animators actually struggle with. Build something fast. Show it to people and _listen_. 

**Iterate based on what actually works, not what I think should work**.

I write specs, manage priorities, and move on from projects that don't resonate. I'm drawn to teams that work this way—identify a real problem, prototype with users, validate, then scale.

I own the full stack—from understanding the problem to shipping code to managing what gets built next. I move fast because I validate early, and I focus on problems that actually matter.

## What I've built

**MotionKit** — Product owner and architect for a deployment-ready pipeline toolset used across animation studios. Born from years of building pipelines in games, it's designed for teams that need reliable, repeatable installs and frictionless workflows. Shipping real value for real studios.

**FindIt** — Built to help people find nearby public toilets with ease. Open source, designed for public good.

**Pipeline & Animation Systems** — Motion editors, blending engines, reconciliation tools. Systems that scale to millions of concurrent players. Tools that save animators and technical directors hours every week.

## Current work

Sr Technical Animator at Tencent (Singapore). Building systems that work for the people using them.
