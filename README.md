I build products that solve real problems. For 8+ years I've shipped animation systems for millions of players by obsessing over what actually breaks workflows and then building the thing that fixes it.

My approach: **watch → identify the real friction → prototype → validate with users → ship**.

I don't wait for perfect specs. I move fast. I talk to the people doing the work, understand what's actually broken, code a solution, put it in their hands, and iterate based on what they actually need. 

I own the full stack—from understanding the problem to shipping code to managing what gets built next. I kill projects that don't move the needle and double down on what works.

## What I build

Animation systems and developer tools that cut through friction. Real products solving real problems—whether that's motion editors that actually work for riggers, pipeline tools that save hours of wasted time, or systems that scale to millions of concurrent users.

## Current work

Sr Technical Animator at Tencent (Singapore). Building systems that work for the people using them.
