# Mandl Cho

I build products that solve real problems. For 8+ years I've shipped animation systems for millions of players.

## How I work

Watch what animators actually struggle with. Build something fast. Show it to people and _listen_. **Iterate based on what actually works, not what I think should work**.

I write specs, manage priorities, and kill projects that don't resonate. I'm drawn to teams that work this way—identify a real problem, prototype with users, validate, then scale.

I own the full stack—from understanding the problem to shipping code to managing what gets built next. I move fast because I validate early, and I focus on problems that actually matter.

## What I've built

Animation systems and developer tools that cut through friction. Motion editors that actually work for riggers, pipeline tools that save hours of wasted time, systems that scale to millions of concurrent users.

## Current work

Sr Technical Animator at Tencent (Singapore). Building systems that work for the people using them.
