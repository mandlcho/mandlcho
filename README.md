# Mandl Cho

Product builder shipping workflow tools and prototypes with clear input/output loops, tight scope, and measurable outcomes.

Singapore.

## Selected work

### SpendWhat? (in progress)
Telegram-first expense capture + web one-pager insights.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/SpendWhat
- Focus: minimal setup, minimal dependencies, privacy-respecting by default.
- Core loop: capture (Telegram) → normalize (rules) → review (needs_review) → insight (MTD, category/merchant).

### MotionKit
Deployable multi-DCC pipeline toolset for MotionBuilder and 3ds Max.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/MotionKit
- Focus: repeatable installs, discoverability via menus, team-friendly distribution.

### p4chimari
A Windows tool to manage Perforce workspace changes with an Unreal Engine-style workflow.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/p4chimari
- Focus: safer reconcile/revert workflows, reduced changelist noise, fast cleanup.

### blueprint-gpt
Generate, preview, and edit Unreal Engine Blueprint graphs in the browser.
- Repo: https://github.com/mandlcho/blueprint-gpt
- Focus: shorten the “intent → node graph” loop; dataset tooling for blueprint nodes.

## Product work (analysis)
I write teardown notes and roadmaps the same way I would for a product team.
- Firefly III analysis: why it works (rules + recurring + reports + API-first) and where to beat it.
- Agamotto (wheel strategy manager): what’s strong (strategy grouping + action-oriented monitor) and what to improve (alerts, explainability, broker sync).

## How I work
- Start with the input loop: capture frictionlessly, then make output worth it.
- Prototype early, measure quickly, cut scope aggressively.
- Prefer simple, auditable rules before adding “AI”.
- Design for ops: defaults, safety rails, and failure modes.
