I'm a Technical Animator. For 8+ years I've been building animation systems that millions of players use. I work at the messy intersection of design, engineering, and animation—figuring out how to ship things when the requirements are still fuzzy.

## How I approach work

Watch what animators actually struggle with. Build something fast. Show it to people and listen. Iterate based on what actually works, not what I think should work.

I write specs, manage priorities, and kill projects that don't resonate. I'm drawn to teams that work this way—identify a real problem, prototype with users, validate, then scale.

## Stack

React, TypeScript, Python, Unreal Engine, SCSS, Vite, Jekyll
