## Who I Am

I'm a **Technical Animator** with 8+ years of experience turning vague creative briefs into working animation systems that millions of players experience every day. My role sits at the intersection of **Design**, **Engineering**, and **Animation**—which means I'm constantly figuring out how to ship ambiguous ideas at scale.

## How I Work

**Identify → Prototype → Validate → Ship**

- 🔍 **Identify pain points** through direct observation of animators and systems
- ⚡ **Rapid prototyping** in code before committing engineering resources  
- ✅ **Validate ideas** through user feedback and real-world testing
- 🔄 **Iterate fast** based on what actually resonates

I write user stories to clarify requirements, manage roadmaps across competing priorities, and kill ideas that don't move the needle. I'm drawn to environments with operating philosophies like **proactively identify problems → prototype with real users → validate what works → scale it**.

## What I Build

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Animation Systems** | Motion editors, blending engines, procedural systems that scale to millions of players |
| **Prototyping & Tools** | Rapid validation frameworks, iteration-focused tooling for design-engineering handoff |
| **Documentation** | Process notes, architecture guides, and knowledge sharing for other builders |
